# Tree Saw

Userscript for web browsers. Runs on gumtree.pl and adds an eye icon next to each entry in the listing. When you click the eye, the offer gets dimmed (15% opacity), and its description is saved to local storage, so that duplicate offers on subsequent pages are dimmed as well.

Made to eliminate duplicate offers, which may appear quite a lot when searching for a house. To bump their offers to the top, brokers tend to re-issue them, without deleting the previous entries. Tree Saw lets you hide these, as long as the description matches.

Then, copy the contents of the user.js file from this repo and paste it in your extension's editor.
